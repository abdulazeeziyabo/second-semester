## Question
Implement an API fetch of your GitHub portfolio, show a page with a list of all your repositories on GitHub, and create another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the page showing all repos using nested routes while using all the necessary tools in react. Implement an Error Boundary (show a page to test the error boundary) and 404 pages. Good UI and Designs are important.</p>

# GitHub  API  Repository Portfolio
<p>A simple GitHub API app built with React. This app shows all my GitHub repositories in a page and upon a click on 'show more' show individual details on each repository. The app also has an error boundary page when something goes wrong and a 404 page when a wrong page is entered. 

# Setup
I setup my app using Vite and deleted files and folders not wanted. I created  views, component and layouts folders.
